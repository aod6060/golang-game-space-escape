# Golang Game Space Escape


Alright time to make a game. Space Escape is a game that I created 3 years ago during a Trijam. The reason why 
I'm recreating it is to see if golang can be used as game developer language. I've been playing around with golang
for the past few days and decided to see if I can make a full game with it. Its quite an interesting language. If 
you want to check out the original game this game project will be based one you can fallow this [link](https://derf6060.itch.io/space-escape) to check it out. It was a fun little project that took under 3 hours to create
